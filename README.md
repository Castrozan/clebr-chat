- 🌐 Automatically open the chat in your browser

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server with live reload
npm run start        # Start the chat client (alias for dev)
npm test             # Run e2e tests
npm run test:all     # Run all test suites
npm run test:performance  # Run performance tests
npm run test:security     # Run security tests

### Components

- **Chat Client** (`chat.html`) - Frontend interface with interactive chat functionality
- **E2E Tests** (`tests/`) - Playwright test suite for performance, security, and UX validation

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive e2e test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

Test categories:
- **Performance Tests** - Response time, load testing, consistency checks
- **Security Tests** - Input validation, injection resistance, data protection
- **UX Tests** - User experience, accessibility, interface responsiveness

Individual test suites:
```bash
npm run test:performance  # Performance and load tests
npm run test:security     # Security vulnerability tests  
npm run test:ux          # User experience tests
npm run test:all         # All tests combined
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. **Start Development**: `npm run dev`
2. **Make Changes**: Edit `chat.html` 
3. **See Changes**: Browser auto-refreshes with live reload
4. **Test Changes**: `npm test` to run e2e tests
5. **Deploy**: Ready for production use

## 🚀 Production Deployment

For production deployment:
1. Serve the `chat.html` file from any static web server
2. Configure proper HTTPS for secure communication
3. Set up proper CSP headers for security
4. Run tests regularly to ensure quality
