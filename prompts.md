Ok, we are ready to implement. 

Yes we should preserv all current features, mcp managment and backend integration. We will refactor how these thigs will work after.

You can start implementing. Find in the web the best way to initialize the nextjs project and acomplish these goals 

- Initialize Next.js with TypeScript
- Set up Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui

You can run commands to run the app and test it with curl. Make sure its working. If you keep not being able to fix something, exit earlier and ask me for help
